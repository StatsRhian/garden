# Welcome ðŸŒ¸

Welcome to my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

I struggle with [long form blogging](https://rhian.rbind.io/posts), so this a space for slowly turning shower-thoughts and stories into little opinionated snippets.

My aim is to create a space where ideas are:

- shared early

- developed in public

- constantly growing, evolving, and changing

I made this garden for me, but you're welcome to wander through it. ðŸŒ±
