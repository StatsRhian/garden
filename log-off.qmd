## Before You Set Your Out-of-Office, Do This 

The week before a holiday used to be chaos for meâ€”scrambling to finish everything before setting my out-of-office. And coming back? Even worse. I'd stare at my inbox, wondering what I was even working on before I left. Then I found a simple fix: writing a quick note to future me before I log off.

Why does this work?âœ¨ You donâ€™t need to finish everything before your holiday. Take the pressure off! Instead, capture the important things so you can pick up easily when you're back.

Here's what I include:
ðŸ“‹ Project Summary: Where I'm at and whatâ€™s next
âœ… Unfinished Tasks: Priorities for when I return
ðŸ’¡ New Ideas: So I donâ€™t lose good thoughts
ðŸ”§ Easy First-Day Tasks: Small wins to get back into it

This tiny habit makes the first day back feel productive and way less overwhelming. So before your next break, take five minutes to write that note to future you. Your post-holiday self will thank you!

And with that, I'm off to Skye. See you in a week ðŸ‘‹

 I post on slack / calendar when I'm going for a run

 I started a Strava group for my company. My boss gives me kudos for getting out in the day time

 Going for a run in the middle of the day in winter makes me a better coder
