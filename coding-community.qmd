## Why I don't do advent of code

Every December, my timeline fills with people tackling Advent of Code, and every year, I feel like I _should_ take part. But honestly it just stresses me out.

- I feel like I have to participate and have to get everything right (which, I know, isn’t the point—it’s about learning).
- I don’t enjoy the pressure. The daily pace makes me feel like I’m falling behind before I’ve even started.
- I want to prioritise getting outside during winter, not spending more time huddled over a laptop.
- I love puzzles—cryptic crosswords, Connections, lateral thinking games—but I don’t love these kinds of algorithm-heavy coding challenges. I have way more fun spinning up a website or building an R package.

Maybe the solution isn’t skipping it entirely but doing it my way. Instead of racing through daily problems, what if I just picked one challenge and did it really well? Fully documented, tested, and even turned into a fun little project.

Setting a time limit and sharing my progress publicly—showing what I can do in, say, 30 minutes and letting go of perfectionism. Like how Nicola Rennie did [15 minute maps](https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/30-day-map-challenge-2022/) for the [#30DayMapChallenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge), but for AoC.
