## Don't talk yourself down

- "I bet you're all bored"

- "This work isn't very good"

- "You probably don't care about this"

These are all statements I've heard from _brilliant_ colleagues when presenting their work.

I love working with smart, humble people. Much better than egotistical idiots. But when sharing your ideas publicly, please don't down talk yourself unnecessarily. We're listening to you for a reason, and if you start saying this stuff enough, people start to believe you.
