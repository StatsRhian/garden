# Remote working

## Why I won't go back to the office

## Facilitating team trust online 

- [Playing geoguessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/)
- Coworking hours
- Being willing to just hop on a call

## Randomised Coffee Trials (RCT)

- We use these at The Strategy Unit to encourage cross-team chats.
- RainbowR also [use a buddy scheme](https://rainbowr.org/buddies.html) to get community members to connect.
- My PhD scheme has used it to allow current students to network with alumni
