# Git tips

## Branch to new repo

- Create new repo
- Checkout old repo locally
- `git push https://github.com/accountname/new-repo.git +new-project:master`

## Ignore blame

Useful for with air formatting @sec-airformatting

- TIL - you can use git blame ignore to ignore commits that just do formatting in blame
- How we [implemented it](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_outputs/pull/336)
- What it looks like [in practice](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_outputs/blame/main/R/fct_get_data.R)

## Use the force, wisely {#sec-gitforce}

I used to be scared to force push to a repo. Once I got more comfortable with @sec-gitrebase I started doing it more often. However, I never type `git push --force` instead I always use `git push --force-with-lease`.

The latter will not overwrite any work on the remote branch if more commits have been added. This ensures you do not overwrite someone elses work by force pushing - much safer.

## Gitmoji taught me to love modular commits 😍{#sec-gitmoji}

I started using [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) because it looked fun 🌟 but eventually, it changed how I write commits.

Picking an emoji forced me to pause and ask: What’s actually happening in this commit? Instead of dumping changes together, I began writing smaller, focused commits with clear messages. 

I also had to learn a little of how to rebase, as I found my

That shift led me to embrace rebase: squashing clutter, rewording for clarity, and keeping histories clean. Reviews got easier too—stepping through commits in GitHub became smooth and logical.

Gitmoji didn’t just make my commits pretty, it made them better. And my work day got a little more fun too 🦩

## True CI/CD 

The only way you can truly do continuous integration is with a branching strategy of push-to-main.
But that's pretty scary.

## GitHub rulesets

### What

Rulesets help you to control how people can interact with branches and tags in a repository. 
A ruleset is a named list of rules that applies to a repository. You can have up to 75 rulesets per repository.

### Who can use them

- Public repos for GitHub free, public and private repositories with paid plans
- Paid feature: you can set up organisation level rulesets

### What can you control

- Who can push to a branch
- Require approvals (how many, who can review)
- Commit style (paid only)

### How are they different from branch protection?

- Can be toggled as active / inactive without being deleted
- Can apply at the same time
- Visible to anyone with read access, meaning as a developer you can understand what the issue is
- You can enforce conventional commits. (paid only) 
    - Can I enforce gitmoji commits on my repo?


### How do I get started?

GitHub has a couple of pre-made rulesets: https://github.com/github/ruleset-recipes

You can also use the GUI to make some rulesets, and then export them and share them.

- You can protect main - here's how

- You can skip the approval - handy for bots like all-contributors

- You can export / import them

## Using GitHub efficiently

- keyboard shortcuts
- reviewing commit-by-commit
- setting up personal filters
